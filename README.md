        <h1>Happy Birthday, Love!</h1>
        <p>First things first, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LOVE! I know it's completely normal to feel nervous when writing about your feelings but here's something I want to share, heartfelt thoughts and a few more emotion-filled words. Here's a poem I've written with my love and feelings, hope you like it!</p>
        <h2>In Your Eyes</h2>
        <p>I thought I was in love with you,<br>
        Your shiny eyes, so bright and true.<br>
        I saw my future in your gaze,<br>
        A happy me, in so many ways.</p>
        <p>I saw those eyes filled with tears,<br>
        But the girl in them had to face her fears.<br>
        She tried to soak up all the pain,<br>
        With her hand, like a sponge in the rain.</p>
        <p>We've been through a lot, it's true,<br>
        But these fights make us strong, me and you.<br>
        I've never loved anyone more,<br>
        And that's a promise down to my core.</p>
        <p>You say I light up your world so bright,<br>
        But you've changed mine, day and night.<br>
        You love geography, your globe so wide,<br>
        But in my mind, it's you worldwide.</p>
        <p>You are my world, my everything,<br>
        Through messy times and what they bring.<br>
        I want you to stay, through thick and thin,<br>
        When people doubt, and when we win.</p>
        <p>I want you to stay and never part our ways,<br>
        Or when they say it's just a phase.<br>
        I want you, and only you,<br>
        I'm in love with you, it's true.</p>
        <p>Through every storm and every fight,<br>
        You are my guiding light.<br>
        In your eyes, I see my dreams,<br>
        A love so pure, or so it seems.</p>
        <p>With every heartbeat, every sigh,<br>
        I promise you, I’ll never lie.<br>
        In your arms, I find my peace,<br>
        A love that will never cease.</p>
        <p>So here’s my heart, my soul, my all,<br>
        With you, I’ll rise, with you, I’ll fall.<br>
        Together we’ll face the world so wide,<br>
        With you forever, by my side.</p>
        <p>I love you, I love you, I love you so,<br>
        In every way, I want you to know.</p>
        <p>Happy 19th Birthday, Isha!<br>
        ILOVEYOUTHEMOST!</p>
